# Simple AI Routing Simulator - Python + Streamlit Implementation

## üéØ Project Overview

This is a **super simplified** AI routing simulator using **only Python and Streamlit**. No HTML, CSS, or JavaScript needed! Perfect for college teams who want to focus on the core AI concepts without web development complexity.

## üìÅ Project Structure
```
ai-routing-project/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ ai_routing_simulator.py    # Main Streamlit app
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ simple_demo.py            # Command-line demo
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt          # Python dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md                # Project documentation
```

## üéÆ Demo Flow (5 minutes)

### Step 1: Show Command Line Demo (1 minute)
```bash
python simple_demo.py
```
- Shows both algorithms working
- Clear output showing AI learning to avoid congestion
- No UI complexity, just pure algorithm demonstration

### Step 2: Launch Streamlit App (1 minute)
```bash
streamlit run ai_routing_simulator.py
```
- Beautiful web interface automatically created by Streamlit
- No web development needed!

### Step 3: Interactive Demo (3 minutes)
1. **Normal routing**: A ‚Üí F using both methods
2. **Add congestion**: Click to add congestion to B-D link  
3. **Compare results**: Traditional still uses congested route, AI learns better path
4. **Show learning**: Display Q-table values and training progress

## üß† Core Algorithms (Easy to Explain)

### Traditional Routing (Dijkstra)
```python
def dijkstra_shortest_path(network, source, destination):
    """Always finds shortest path by base distance - ignores congestion"""
    distances = {node: float('inf') for node in network.nodes}
    distances[source] = 0
    # ... standard Dijkstra implementation
    return path
```

**Key Point**: Uses base costs only, never adapts to congestion.

### AI Routing (Q-Learning)
```python
class SimpleQLearning:
    def __init__(self, network):
        self.q_table = {}  # Learns which actions work best
        self.learning_rate = 0.1
        self.epsilon = 0.1  # Exploration vs exploitation
    
    def choose_action(self, state, destination):
        if random.random() < self.epsilon:
            return random.choice(neighbors)  # Explore
        else:
            return best_q_value_action()     # Use learned knowledge
    
    def train_episode(self, source, destination):
        # Learn from experience, update Q-values
        reward = -cost  # Negative cost = good reward
        self.q_table[state, action] += learning_rate * (reward + future_value - current_value)
```

**Key Point**: Learns from experience, adapts to find better routes over time.

## üîë Core Code Snippets to Explain

### Network Representation
```python
class SimpleNetwork:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nodes = ['A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'E', 'F']  # Simple 6-node network
        self.edges = [('A', 'B', 10), ...]           # (from, to, cost)
        self.congestion = {}                         # Track congested links
    
    def get_cost(self, node1, node2):
        base_cost = self.find_edge_cost(node1, node2)
        if self.is_congested(node1, node2):
            return base_cost * 3  # Congested links cost 3x more
        return base_cost
```

### Q-Learning Update Rule (The Heart of AI)
```python
def update_q_value(self, state, action, reward, next_state):
    current_q = self.q_table[(state, action)]
    max_next_q = max(self.q_table[(next_state, a)] for a in possible_actions)
    
    # Q-learning formula
    new_q = current_q + learning_rate * (reward + discount * max_next_q - current_q)
    self.q_table[(state, action)] = new_q
```

### Streamlit Interface (Magical Simplicity)
```python
# This creates a beautiful web app!
source = st.selectbox("Source Node", network.nodes)
destination = st.selectbox("Destination Node", network.nodes)

if st.button("Find AI Path"):
    # Train AI
    for episode in range(50):
        ai_router.train_episode(source, destination)
    
    # Get best path and show results
    path = ai_router.get_best_path(source, destination)
    st.success(f"Best path: {' ‚Üí '.join(path)}")
    
    # Visualize network - Streamlit handles all the complexity!
    fig = visualize_network(network, path)
    st.pyplot(fig)
```
